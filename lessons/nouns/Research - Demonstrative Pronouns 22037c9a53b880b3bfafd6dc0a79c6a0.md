# Demonstrative Pronouns: A Comprehensive Guide for Beginner English Learners

## 1 – Analogy: The Magic Pointing Wands

~~Think of demonstrative pronouns as **magic pointing wands** that help you point to specific things without having to name them~~ over and over again[1](https://www.scribbr.com/nouns-and-pronouns/demonstrative-pronouns/). Just like a magician uses a wand to point at different objects during a show, we use demonstrative pronouns (this, that, these, those) to point at people, places, or things around us[2](https://myenglishgrammar.com/lessons/this-that-these-and-those/)[3](https://www.thesaurus.com/e/grammar/demonstrative-pronouns/).

Imagine you're standing in a room with objects both near and far from you. Your **magic pointing wand** has four different "spells":

- **"This"** - points to ONE thing close to you (like pointing to a book in your hand)
- **"That"** - points to ONE thing far from you (like pointing to a clock on the wall across the room)
- **"These"** - points to MANY things close to you (like pointing to pencils on your desk)
- **"Those"** - points to MANY things far from you (like pointing to cars in a parking lot)

**Definition**: ~~Demonstrative pronouns are special words that replace nouns and help us point to specific people, places, or things~~[1](https://www.scribbr.com/nouns-and-pronouns/demonstrative-pronouns/)[2](https://myenglishgrammar.com/lessons/this-that-these-and-those/). They show whether something is near or far from the speaker, and whether we're talking about one thing (singular) or many things (plural)[4](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/umes-englishcomp1/chapter/demonstrative-pronouns/)[5](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/parts-of-speech/demonstrative-pronouns/). We use them when both the speaker and listener know what we're referring to, making our communication faster and clearer[5](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/parts-of-speech/demonstrative-pronouns/).

## 2 – Awareness: Why Demonstrative Pronouns Matter

Learning demonstrative pronouns is **crucial** for English learners because they appear in everyday conversations constantly[6](https://www.off2class.com/lesson-plan-downloads/teaching-demonstrative-pronouns-the-easy-way/)[7](https://www.yourdictionary.com/articles/this-that-these-those-guide). These words help you:

- **Avoid repetition**: Instead of saying "Can you pass me the book, the red book on the table," you can simply say "Can you pass me that?"[5](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/parts-of-speech/demonstrative-pronouns/)
- **Make introductions**: "This is my friend Sarah" or "These are my classmates"[7](https://www.yourdictionary.com/articles/this-that-these-those-guide)
- **Ask for clarification**: "What is this?" or "ķWhose are those?"[8](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/grammar/english-grammar-reference/demonstratives)
- **Give directions**: "Put that over there" or "Bring these here"[9](https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/english-grammar/demonstratives/)
- **Sound more natural**: Native speakers use demonstrative pronouns frequently in phone conversations, shopping, and daily interactions[7](https://www.yourdictionary.com/articles/this-that-these-those-guide)[8](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/grammar/english-grammar-reference/demonstratives)

Without mastering demonstrative pronouns, your English will sound repetitive and unnatural, making communication less efficient10.

## 3 – Struggles: Common Difficulties and Mistakes

## Beginner Level Mistakes:

1. **Singular/Plural Confusion**: Students often mix up "this/these" or "that/those"11. Example mistake: "This books are expensive" instead of "These books are expensive"
2. **Pronunciation Problems**: The "th" sound is difficult for many learners, and distinguishing between the short "i" in "this" versus the long "ee" in "these" is challenging1213[14](https://www.busuu.com/en/english/demonstrative-pronouns)
3. **Distance Confusion**: Students struggle with when to use "near" (this/these) versus "far" (that/those) demonstratives[15](https://talkpal.ai/grammar/mastering-english-demonstratives-a-comprehensive-guide/)[16](https://english.lingolia.com/en/vocabulary/confusing-words/this-that-these-those)

## Advanced Level Mistakes:

1. **Overuse**: Using demonstrative pronouns too frequently instead of varying language10
2. **Missing Referents**: Using demonstrative pronouns without clear context about what they refer to11[15](https://talkpal.ai/grammar/mastering-english-demonstratives-a-comprehensive-guide/)
3. **Time and Emotional Distance**: Not understanding that "near/far" can refer to time ("this morning" vs "that time long ago") or emotional closeness[4](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/umes-englishcomp1/chapter/demonstrative-pronouns/)[9](https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/english-grammar/demonstratives/)

## 4 – Grammar Overview

**Demonstrative pronouns** are words that replace nouns to point to specific people, places, or things[1](https://www.scribbr.com/nouns-and-pronouns/demonstrative-pronouns/)[3](https://www.thesaurus.com/e/grammar/demonstrative-pronouns/). English has four demonstrative pronouns:

| **Distance** | **Singular** | **Plural** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Near** | this | these |
| **Far** | that | those |

**When to use them**:

- When the noun is already known from context[5](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/parts-of-speech/demonstrative-pronouns/)
- To avoid repeating the same noun multiple times[5](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/parts-of-speech/demonstrative-pronouns/)
- To point out specific items in relation to the speaker's location[4](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/umes-englishcomp1/chapter/demonstrative-pronouns/)
- In introductions and phone conversations[7](https://www.yourdictionary.com/articles/this-that-these-those-guide)

## 5 – Structure & Rules

## Formation Rules:

1. **Distance Rule**:
    - **This/These** = close to the speaker[2](https://myenglishgrammar.com/lessons/this-that-these-and-those/)[16](https://english.lingolia.com/en/vocabulary/confusing-words/this-that-these-those)
    - **That/Those** = far from the speaker[2](https://myenglishgrammar.com/lessons/this-that-these-and-those/)[16](https://english.lingolia.com/en/vocabulary/confusing-words/this-that-these-those)
2. **Number Rule**:
    - **This/That** = singular (one item)[1](https://www.scribbr.com/nouns-and-pronouns/demonstrative-pronouns/)[4](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/umes-englishcomp1/chapter/demonstrative-pronouns/)
    - **These/Those** = plural (multiple items)[1](https://www.scribbr.com/nouns-and-pronouns/demonstrative-pronouns/)[4](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/umes-englishcomp1/chapter/demonstrative-pronouns/)

    ### Introduction to Demonstrative Pronouns
    
    Hello, future English experts! Today, we’re going to explore a fun and practical part of English called demonstrative pronouns. Think of these as the words that help you "point" at things without using your finger. Imagine you're in a room full of interesting objects. Instead of saying each object's name, you can use demonstrative pronouns to refer to them easily.
