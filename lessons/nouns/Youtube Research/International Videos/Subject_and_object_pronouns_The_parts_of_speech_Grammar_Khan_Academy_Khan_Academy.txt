all right so grammarians I want to talk to you about the difference between subject and object pronouns but before we do that let's start off with a little primer on what subjects and objects actually are just generally for our grammatical purposes so in grammar the subject is the part of the sentence or Clause that does a thing the subject does a thing the object on the other hand is the thing that is acted on has stuff done to it the object has stuff done to it so the subject acts the object is acted upon let's give an example so and the sentence Reina wrote an email the subject of the sentence the subject the thing she's doing is writing an email Serena wrote an email email is the object of the verb wrote it is the object of the sentence now there are cases when a sentence doesn't have an object for example we could just say Reina wrote doesn't have an object it's just rain is the subject and then there is no object this is what we call intransitive usage now understanding the relationship between email and Rayna enables you to understand how subject and object pronouns are used so when we're setting out these nouns for pronouns we can figure out which ones we have to use because pronouns have different forms depending on whether or not they are subjects or objects so Raina is a girl's name and if we know that rain is a girl we can refer to her as are there she or her these are two of the feminine pronouns one of these is a subject and one of them is an object she is the subject form and her is the object form so if we wanted to rewrite the sentence speaking of Reyna we would say she wrote an email not her wrote an email you say because her is the object pronoun and therefore is the thing that has the up the object pronoun has stuff done to it as opposed to the doer of things she is the subject form it's the dower for email it's easy this just becomes it in all cases the subject form and I give her a present right now I is the subject her is the object subject but what if we switched it what would it look like that well it wouldn't be her give I a present because since we're switching the subject in the object we're going to be switching the pronouns that we used to so it would be she gave me a present now she is the subject form of her and me is the subject is the object form excuse me me is the object form of I same thing with they and he so they showed him a guitar why not so they is the subject and him is the object and let's give it the old Switcheroo he showed them a guitar so now we do the switcheroo him becomes he so we go from the object form which is him to the subject form which is he and then they the subject form becomes them the object form now when it comes to you and it you're in luck because the subject and object forms of these are the same so subject equals object with you and it so I could say you give it a present just as easily as I could say it gives you a present I didn't realize it changed this to the past tense she gives me a present there we go that's better and that's the difference between a subject and an object pronoun you can learn anything David out
