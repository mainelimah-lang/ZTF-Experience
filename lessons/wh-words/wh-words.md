# **1. Cut years into two**

For almost all the years, we cut them into two — the first two numbers and the second two:

# **2. Remember “oh”**

When the year ends with zero plus a number (e.g. 1903, 1109, 1601) just say “oh” instead of the zero (“nineteen oh-three,” “eleven oh-nine,” “sixteen oh-one”).

Remember, this only works for years after 1000 and not years beginning with 20 (e.g. 2009).

# **3. Use “hundred” or “thousand” when you see lots of zeros**

If the year ends in double zero (e.g. 1400, 1100, 2100) just say “hundred” after the first numbers (“fourteen hundred,” “eleven hundred,” “twenty-one hundred”).

Remember, this doesn’t work for triple zero years (e.g. 1000, 2000, 3000). With these, we just say “thousand” (“one thousand,” “two thousand,” “three thousand”).

# **4. How to say 2001 – 2009**

Although we can say “twenty-oh-three,” a lot of people prefer to say “two thousand and three,” all the way up to “two thousand and ten.”

But what about after that? What happens after 2010?

Apparently, no one can agree on this. So we hear people saying “twenty eleven” and other people saying “two thousand and eleven.” Those people have more energy.

“But that’s mad! Does this continue forever?” I can hear you asking.

The answer is “yes, it is mad” and “fortunately not.”

Because when we get back to 2020, we’re back to the old system again (“twenty twenty,” “twenty twenty-eight,” “twenty fifty-four,” etc.)
