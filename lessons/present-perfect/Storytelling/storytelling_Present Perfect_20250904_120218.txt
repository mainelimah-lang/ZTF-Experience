One quirky fact from Mental Floss that can be used to introduce the Present Perfect tense in a playful way is:

"Did you know that scientists have discovered a species of jellyfish that can age backward? The Turritopsis dohrnii jellyfish is able to revert back to its juvenile form after reaching maturity. So, if you ever feel like you're not making progress, just remember - even jellyfish can hit the reset button on aging!"

This fact can help engage learners in a fun and intriguing manner while also setting the stage for discussing the Present Perfect tense.
