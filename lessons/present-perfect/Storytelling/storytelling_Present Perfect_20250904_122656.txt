One quirky fact from Mental Floss that could be used to introduce Present Perfect in a playful way is: "Did you know that scientists have discovered that people who speak two languages may delay the onset of Alzheimer's by about 4 years? That's a great reason to start learning a new language today!"

This fact not only introduces an interesting and surprising connection between bilingualism and Alzheimer's, but it also sets the stage for discussing actions that have ongoing relevance or implications, which is a key aspect of the Present Perfect tense.
