1. Did you know that the phrase "Present Perfect" has been used in English grammar since the late 19th century? This term was first recorded in the book "A Shorter English Grammar: With Copious and Carefully Graduated Exercises" by C. P. Mason in 1872!

2. Present Perfect is a tense that is often used to talk about experiences. For example, you could say "I've eaten sushi." Interestingly, sushi has been around since the 2nd century A.D. It started as a method of preserving fish in fermented rice in Southeast Asia before making its way to Japan.

3. The Present Perfect tense is used to describe ongoing experiences. For instance, you could say, "I've been collecting coins for years." Fun fact: The world's largest coin collection is owned by King Farouk of Egypt, who ruled from 1936 to 1952. His collection included over one million coins!

4. The Present Perfect tense is also used to talk about accomplishments. For example, "NASA has sent rovers to Mars". Speaking of NASA, did you know that they accidentally taped over the original footage of the moon landing? Thankfully, they've been able to recover it from other sources.

5. The phrase "Has anyone ever told you..." is an example of a question in the Present Perfect tense. Here's a fun fact related to that phrase: According to a study published by Nicholas Christenfeld and Jonathan Leavitt of UC San Diego, people actually prefer spoilers. The researchers found that subjects preferred spoiled stories to unspoiled ones. So, next time you could ask, "Has anyone ever spoiled a movie for you?"

6. In the Present Perfect tense, we often use the word 'just' to express recent actions. For example, "I've just finished reading a book." Speaking about books, the world's smallest book is a 22-page Japanese book, which requires a magnifying glass to read. 

7. The Present Perfect tense is often used to express life experiences, like "I've never seen the ocean." Surprisingly, more people have been to the moon than to the deepest part of the ocean, the Mariana Trench!

Remember, these fun facts not only make learning English more enjoyable but also demonstrate how the Present Perfect tense is used in everyday conversation.
