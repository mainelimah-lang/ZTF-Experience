1. "The English language is a linguistic thief." English has borrowed or stolen words from nearly every other language it's encountered, resulting in a language with a huge vocabulary. It has over 170,000 words in current use, and another 50,000 obsolete words. 

2. "The English language has a term for almost everything." For example, did you know that the dot over an 'i' or 'j' is called a tittle? 

3. "The longest English word is 189,819 letters long." It's the chemical name for the protein known as titin and would take about three hours to pronounce!

4. "There's no word in the English language that rhymes with month, orange, silver, or purple." 

5. "The most commonly used letter in the English alphabet is 'E', and 'Q' is the least used!" 

6. "The word 'set' has the highest number of definitions in the English language at 430."

7. "The shortest complete sentence in English is 'Go.' Just two letters and you've said a whole lot!" 

8. "The word 'run' is expected to surpass 'set' in the number of meanings. It currently has 396 senses listed in the Oxford English Dictionary."

9. "English is a stress-timed language, meaning that we say some syllables slower and some faster, which is different from syllable-timed languages where every syllable has equal length."

10. "The English language is a bit of a magpie, having borrowed words from over 350 other languages."
