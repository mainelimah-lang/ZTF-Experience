Here's a quirky fact from Mental Floss that can make learning the alphabet more playful:

Did you know that the letter "E" is the most commonly used letter in the English language, but it is not the most common starting letter for words? The most common starting letter is actually "T"!

Introducing this fact to learners can make them curious about the different patterns and usage of letters in the alphabet, adding a fun and surprising twist to their understanding of language.
