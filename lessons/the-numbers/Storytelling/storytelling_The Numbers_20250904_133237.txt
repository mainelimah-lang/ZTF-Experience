Certainly! Here are a few quirky and fun facts from Mental Floss that could be used to introduce The Numbers in a playful way:

1. "Did you know that the number 8 is considered lucky in many cultures around the world? In China, the word for 'eight' sounds similar to the word for 'prosper' or 'wealth,' making it a popular choice for phone numbers and license plates."

2. "The number 3 is often referred to as the 'magic number' in mathematics. It is the only number that, when added to itself, multiplied by itself, or raised to the power of itself, results in the same number."

3. "In a survey conducted by a mattress company, it was found that 41% of people have a favorite number. The most popular choice? Number 7, followed closely by numbers 3 and 8."

4. "The Fibonacci sequence, a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, can be found in nature in the spirals of sunflowers, the branching of trees, and even the arrangement of scales on a pine cone."
